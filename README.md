This repository contains a demonstration of a common React Native linking error and its solution. The error, 'Native Module Not Found,' arises when a native module (often a library requiring native code compilation) is incorrectly linked to your project.  The solution involves verifying the correct setup and linking process for the native module, as detailed in the included solution file.  This example focuses on a simplified scenario for clarity.
