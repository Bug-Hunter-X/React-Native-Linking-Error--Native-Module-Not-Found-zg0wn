To solve this issue, ensure that you have correctly linked the native module using the appropriate method for your native module and React Native version. For example, if you're using React Native's autolinking feature (available in newer versions), make sure that your project's configuration and package.json are correct. If autolinking is not working or you have an older React Native version, you will have to manually link the library according to the module's instructions.  This usually involves running a linking script or adding the library to your Xcode or Android Studio project.  If the problem persists, ensure all necessary native dependencies of the module are correctly installed in the native project.
